# Get It Done

A template for starting projects with `express` as an API. Includes
authentication and common middlewares.

An express API for a productivity application.
A productivity application to keep track of tasks you need to get done.
This application allows the user to create tasks and show them on their own to do list, delete them when they are done and edit them if necessary. Maybe here's a reason why I wanted to do this project, or came up with this idea.
